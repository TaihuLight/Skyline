Skyline Query Application
=======

This is a final year project based on Skyline queries.

The code has not been modified since 2013, despite having multiple bugs and leaks.
The author wants to preserve each one of the above issues as a personal "timeline". 
Reviewing the code after a few years with a bit more of experience reveals the personal professional growth.

Each line in the code describes the young programmer, his way of thinking, the ambitions, the will and all his attitude towards new challenges.
Since the project was completed many things have evolved, new skills have been acquired and many more lines of code been written.

Nowadays I’d rewrite the entire code to be more readable, maintainable and testable. But that would erase an important part of my past:
Where I came from and how far I’ve gone.

“Consider your origin: you were not made to live like brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge”
